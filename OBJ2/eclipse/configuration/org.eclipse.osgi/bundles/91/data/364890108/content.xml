          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7.

GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution.

While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering.

In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

For &#xA;example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient &#xA;to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s responsibility to acquire &#xA;that license before distributing the Program.&#xA;&#xA;d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient &#xA;copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright &#xA;license set forth in this Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;3. REQUIREMENTS&#xA;&#xA;A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form &#xA;under its own license agreement, provided that:&#xA;&#xA;a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) its license agreement:&#xA;&#xA;i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties &#xA;and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions &#xA;of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of &#xA;merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xA;&#xA;ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for &#xA;damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and &#xA;consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xA;&#xA;iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are &#xA;offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xA;&#xA;iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such &#xA;Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable &#xA;manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xA;&#xA;When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xA;&#xA;a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xA;&#xA;b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the &#xA;Program.&#xA;&#xA;Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained &#xA;within the Program.&#xA;&#xA;Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its &#xA;Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent &#xA;Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xA;&#xA;4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xA;&#xA;Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities &#xA;with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this &#xA;license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the &#xA;Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering &#xA;should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for &#xA;other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in &#xA;a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&#xA;&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;&#xA;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (&#xA;collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal &#xA;actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to &#xA;the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial &#xA;Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a &#xA;commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not &#xA;apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged &#xA;intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified &#xA;Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in &#xA;writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to &#xA;control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense &#xA;and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may &#xA;participate in any such claim at its own expense.&#xA;&#xA;For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial &#xA;product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial &#xA;Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance &#xA;claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance &#xA;claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility &#xA;alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to &#xA;defend claims against the other Contributors related to those &#xA;performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other &#xA;Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor &#xA;must pay those damages.&#xA;&#xA;5. NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED &#xA;ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, &#xA;EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES &#xA;OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR &#xA;A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for &#xA;determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program &#xA;and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this &#xA;Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program &#xA;errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, &#xA;programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xA;&#xA;6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xA;&#xA;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR &#xA;ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, &#xA;INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING &#xA;WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF &#xA;LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING &#xA;NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR &#xA;DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED &#xA;HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;7. GENERAL&#xA;&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under &#xA;applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of &#xA;the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action &#xA;by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum &#xA;extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xA;&#xA;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including &#xA;a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program &#xA;itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or &#xA;hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such Recipient&apos;s &#xA;rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such &#xA;litigation is filed.&#xA;&#xA;All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails &#xA;to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement &#xA;and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after &#xA;becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s rights under &#xA;this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution &#xA;of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s &#xA;obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient &#xA;relating to the Program shall continue and survive.&#xA;&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, &#xA;but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may &#xA;only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves &#xA;the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this &#xA;Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has &#xA;the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the &#xA;initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the &#xA;responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate &#xA;entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing &#xA;version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be &#xA;distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was &#xA;received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published&#xA;, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its &#xA;Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in &#xA;Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses &#xA;to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, &#xA;whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in &#xA;the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.&#xA;&#xA;This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the &#xA;intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to &#xA;this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than &#xA;one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights &#xA;to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.&#xA;'/>

          Eclipse Public License - v 1.0&#xA;&#xA;THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE &#xA;PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF &#xA;THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xA;&#xA;1. DEFINITIONS&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contribution&quot; means:&#xA;&#xA;a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and &#xA;documentation distributed under this Agreement, and&#xA;b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:&#xA;&#xA;i) changes to the Program, and&#xA;&#xA;ii) additions to the Program;&#xA;&#xA;where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and &#xA;are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;&#xA;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such &#xA;Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s behalf. &#xA;Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are &#xA;separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program &#xA;under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of &#xA;the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which &#xA;are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone &#xA;or when combined with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this &#xA;Agreement.&#xA;&#xA;&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, &#xA;including all Contributors.&#xA;&#xA;2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xA;&#xA;a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright &#xA;license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, &#xA;publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such &#xA;Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and &#xA;object code form.&#xA;&#xA;b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby &#xA;grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license &#xA;under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and &#xA;otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in &#xA;source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the &#xA;combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the &#xA;Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the &#xA;Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed &#xA;Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations &#xA;which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.&#xA;&#xA;c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the &#xA;licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are &#xA;provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the &#xA;patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each &#xA;Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by &#xA;any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights &#xA;or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses &#xA;granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to &#xA;secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
